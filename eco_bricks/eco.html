            Eco bricks are plastic bottles filled with non-biodegradable waste such as plastic bags, candy wrappers, and
            styrofoam, packed tightly to create a building block. These bricks can be used in construction projects as
            an alternative to traditional bricks. They are made from materials that would otherwise end up in landfills
            and are also a sustainable building solution as they reduce the need for traditional bricks, which are often
            made from clay and require a significant amount of energy to produce. Additionally, eco bricks can also be
            used in community-based projects such as building schools, houses, and other structures. It is a creative
            solution to plastic pollution and it makes people more aware of their plastic consumption.

        “Weekend never goes unproductive, when there is a productive mindset.”<br>
        Therefore Sambhav foundation is exited for its eco-bricks campaign, along with BDF bgo.
        Eco bricks are plastic bottles filled with non-biodegradable waste such as plastic bags, candy wrappers, and
        styrofoam, packed tightly to create a building block.
        Eco bricks can also serve as a valuable educational tool, as they help to raise awareness about the importance
        of reducing plastic waste and the impact that plastic has on the environment. They also help to promote
        sustainable living and encourage individuals and communities to take an active role in protecting the
        environment.
