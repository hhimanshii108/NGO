            Cleanliness drives are important for maintaining a clean and healthy environment.
            They help to remove litter, debris, and other forms of pollution from our streets,
            parks, and other public spaces. They also promote a sense of civic responsibility
            and community engagement, as residents come together to take care of their shared
            environment. Additionally, cleanliness drives can have economic benefits, as a clean
            environment can attract tourism and businesses. Overall, cleanliness drives are an important
            tool in promoting public health, environmental sustainability, and community engagement.

        <h3>Selaqui Cleanup Drive </h3>
        <h3>5/11/21</h3>
        <br>
        SAMBHAV FOUNDATION along with BDF NGO witnessed a Cleanup Drive along the Dehradun Selaqui Highway,
        Jhajhra.
        Main focus of the activity was to encourage awareness about pet plastic. PET does'nt readily break down, it
        contributes
        to plastic pollution.
        "Plastic like PET can break down into tiny pieces called microplastics, which are pervasive in our oceans - as
        well as our,
        bays,lakes,and even drinking water.
        PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic is a type of plastic that is widely used for packaging food, beverages,
        and other consumer products. However, PET plastic can have significant environmental and health hazards.
        One of the main hazards of PET plastic is that it is not biodegradable, meaning that it does not decompose in
        the environment. When PET plastic is discarded and ends up in the environment, it can take hundreds of years to
        break down, causing pollution and contributing to the buildup of plastic.

        <h3>Tapkeshwar Temple </h3>
        <h3>Monsoon Cleanup drive</h3>
        <h3>24/07/21</h3>
        <br>
        SAMBHAV FOUNDATION witnessed a "Monsoon Cleanup Drive" at Tapkeshwar Temple.
        Voulnteers participated actively and did their part with utmost responsibility
        showing keen interest towards the cleanliness of society.
        Monsoon clean up drives are an important initiative that takes place during the rainy season.
        The goal of this drive was to clean up temple to prevent flooding and other monsoon-related hazard.
        The clean up drives typically involve the removal of debris, such as fallen branches and leaves, from streets,
        sidewalks, and drainage systems, as well as the cleaning of catch basins and stormwater ponds.
        Additionally, the drives may also involve the removal of litter and waste materials from public spaces and
        the cleaning of drains to ensure proper water flow. Monsoon clean up drives are important in maintaining the
        cleanliness of the community and also prevent flooding and water-logging.
