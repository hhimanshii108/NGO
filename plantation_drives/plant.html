            The Green Vibes Only campaign is a movement that promotes environmentally-friendly and sustainable living.
            It encourages individuals to make small changes in their daily lives to reduce their impact on the
            environment. These changes can include using reusable bags and water bottles, reducing meat consumption, and
            conserving energy. The campaign also raises awareness about the importance of protecting the planet and the
            need for collective action to address climate change. Overall, the goal of the Green Vibes Only campaign is
            to create a more sustainable future for all.
            The Green Vibes Only campaign also often organizes plantation drives, as planting trees is an important step
            in promoting sustainable living and combating climate change.

        950+ Trees planted in past 30 days.<br>
        Through plantation drives, the Green Vibes Only campaign aims to not only raise awareness about the importance
        of trees but also to actively contribute to their preservation and growth. These drives are typically held in
        public parks or other community spaces and are open to volunteers of all ages. They also educate people about
        the importance of maintaining the plantation and how to care for the plants.

        <h3>Asharodi Protest </h3>
        <h3>11/04/22</h3>
        <br>
        Asharodi Protest- A large number of trees were chopped off because of Delhi-Dehradun expressway!
        The trees of Asharodi forest have rich history since British era and serve as home for various small and large
        animals and birds. Thus, keeping the call of an hour in mind our team stood up actively with
        some local organisations working on eco-preservation. They also provides biodiversity to a lot of native floral
        species. They are the pioneer of Doon Valley and are the reason for the pleasant weather enjoyed by local and
        tourists collectively.<br>
        We should come together to save our forests and protect our Valley from being another Delhi!<br>

        Green Doon or Concrete Doon?!<br>
        Choice is ours!!!<br>
        Please come forward to stop this menace.
