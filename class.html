            The Slums to Classroom campaign is a social initiative aimed at providing education and resources to
            children living in slums. The campaign is focused on improving access to quality education for children
            living in poverty-stricken areas, where many families struggle to afford basic necessities such as food and
            shelter, let alone education. This campaign provides supplementary education to the children outside of the
            classroom through extracurricular
            activities, such as sports and music programs, and providing health and nutrition support. The ultimate goal
            of the Slums to Classroom campaign is to break the cycle of poverty by providing children living in slums
            with the education and resources they need to succeed in life. The campaign is driven by a passion for
            improving the lives of marginalized children and creating a more equitable society.
